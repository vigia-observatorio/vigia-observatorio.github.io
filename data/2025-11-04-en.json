These risks include algorithmic malfunction and errors (R1), discrimination and bias (R2), privacy invasions (R3), disinformation (R4), authoritarian surveillance (R9), concentration of power (R10), war escalation (R12), and gradual loss of control over critical systems (R13), with severity levels reaching \"Very High\" and \"Extreme.\"\n\nThe main recommended action is the urgent development of a transversal regulatory framework for AI in Mexico, addressing transparency, explainability, bias auditing, human oversight, and accountability in all identified sectors.
