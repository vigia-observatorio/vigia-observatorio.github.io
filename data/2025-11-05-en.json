These systems, which use platforms like 'TrabajaEn' and 'Módulo Generador de Exámenes', likely employ AI/ML for automatic scoring, proctoring, or candidate profiling. This carries significant risks: algorithmic discrimination (R2) if training data or algorithms are biased, which could exclude qualified candidates from diverse backgrounds. Errors (R1) in these automated systems could lead to unfair disqualification.

  "executive_summary": "This issue of the Official Gazette of the Federation, dated November 5, 2025, although it contains no explicit mentions of 'Artificial Intelligence', reveals a profound and growing dependence on automated systems and advanced data analysis across various Federal Secretariats. The implicit findings range from the digitalization of procedures and personnel evaluation in public calls, to the management of cadastral information, health quality monitoring, and economic analysis for price setting.\n\nThe most critical risks identified are at the 'Extreme' level, mainly due to the potential 'Gradual Loss of Control' (R13) over critical systems in areas such as environmental management and IT infrastructure, as well as 'Very High' risks of 'Authoritarian Surveillance' (R9) in sensitive databases like BANAVIM. Other 'High' risks include 'Malfunctions & Errors' (R1), 'Discrimination & Bias' (R2), and 'Privacy Invasions' (R3) in personnel evaluation processes, health diagnoses, and data management for victims of violence. The lack of specific regulatory frameworks for AI in these domains creates legal vacuums that could have serious consequences for citizens' rights and governance.\n\nUrgent action is recommended to develop comprehensive AI regulation that addresses transparency, auditability, bias mitigation, human oversight, and appeal mechanisms in all identified AI systems. It is crucial for Mexico to establish robust safeguards to protect its citizens, especially vulnerable populations, from the potential negative impacts of AI, while responsibly leveraging its benefits.",
