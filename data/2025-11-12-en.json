This evaluation includes, among other elements, an examination of: a. The volume of imports under dumping conditions, their price, and the effect of these on the domestic prices of the like product. b.

Although it does not explicitly mention AI, the complexity and volume of economic, statistical, and financial data that must be processed to 'determine' the injury and its 'repercussion' strongly suggest the use of advanced data analysis algorithms, including machine learning techniques for the detection of dumping patterns or the simulation of economic impacts. The 'systematization of information to facilitate the decision-making process' (page 234, Coordination of Injury and Safeguards) is a key indicator.\n\nIDENTIFIED RISKS:\nR1 (Malfunctions & Errors): Errors in data analysis algorithms could lead to incorrect determinations of dumping or injury, resulting in unfair countervailing duties that affect importing or exporting companies.\nR2 (Discrimination & Bias): If the analysis models are biased by historical data or the way 'dumping patterns' are defined, they could unfairly discriminate against certain countries or products, affecting trade relations.\nR10 (Concentration of Power): Dependence on sophisticated analytical tools could concentrate the power of analysis and decision-making in a few hands, or favor large companies with access to these technologies.\n\nCRITICAL REGULATORY GAPS:\n1. Absence of transparency requirements regarding the algorithmic methodology used for data analysis in anti-dumping investigations.\n2. Lack of independent audit mechanisms to verify the fairness and accuracy of data analysis systems.\n3. No criteria are established for the evaluation of algorithmic biases in the determination of injury or dumping.\n\nCONSIDERATIONS IN THE MEXICAN CONTEXT:\n- Limited regulatory enforcement capacity could hinder the oversight of the fairness and accuracy of these systems.\n- Technological dependence on foreign providers could imply the use of 'black boxes' without transparency about their operation.\n- Erroneous decisions in foreign trade can have a significant impact on the national economy and labor informality if they affect supply chains or small and medium-sized enterprises.",

Digitalization and the use of biometrics are areas of high AI application, especially for identity verification, document processing, and procedure automation. The management of land tenure is a critical domain.\n\nIDENTIFIED RISKS:\nR1 (Malfunctions & Errors): Errors in biometric recognition systems or in the automated digitalization and processing of agrarian documents could lead to identity theft, loss of land rights, or incorrect property assignment, with devastating social and economic consequences.\nR2 (Discrimination & Bias): Biometric recognition algorithms may have inherent biases that disproportionately affect certain demographic groups (e.g., people with darker skin, older adults, people with disabilities), hindering their access to essential services or their own legal identity. In the agrarian context, this could affect indigenous or rural communities.\nR3 (Privacy Invasions): The centralization of biometric data and its use as national identification, along with the digitalization of property records, represents a massive risk of privacy invasion and state surveillance if robust and transparent safeguards on how this data is collected, stored, processed, and used are not in place. The risk of security breaches is very high.\nR13 (Gradual Loss of Control): The delegation of identity verification and property record management to automated systems with biometrics, without effective human oversight and reversal mechanisms, could lead to a gradual loss of control over critical state functions and citizens' fundamental rights.\n\nCRITICAL REGULATORY GAPS:\n1. Absence of specific regulation on the use of AI in the processing of biometric data for national identification.\n2. Lack of a legal framework that establishes standards of accuracy, fairness, and auditability for biometric systems and the digitalization of critical procedures.\n3. No rights are mentioned for citizens to challenge automated decisions or errors in their biometric/digital records.\n4. No explicit safeguards exist regarding the interoperability of biometric databases with other governmental systems.\n\nCONSIDERATIONS IN THE MEXICAN CONTEXT:\n- Digital inequality and limited access to technology in rural areas and indigenous communities could exacerbate biases and hinder access to digitalized procedures.\n- High informality in land tenure in some regions could generate inconsistent data that AI systems might misinterpret.\n- Limited regulatory enforcement capacity and personal data protection (INAI) might be insufficient to oversee a national biometric system of this magnitude.\n- The risk of misuse of biometric data by the State or private actors is very high in a context of consolidating democratic institutions.",

The 'dissemination of titles and authors' could also benefit from recommendation algorithms.\n\nIDENTIFIED RISKS:\nR4 (Disinformation & Deepfakes): If AI is used to generate voices for audiobooks or to create content in 'transmedia narratives', there is a risk that these technologies could be misused to produce manipulated synthetic content or disinformation, especially if voices of authors or public figures are imitated without consent, or if narratives that distort reality are generated.\nR5 (Copyright Infringement): The training of AI models with copyrighted works (texts, images, audio) without the consent of the rights holders, or the generation of AI content that reproduces distinctive styles or elements of existing works, could constitute a massive violation of intellectual property. The legal uncertainty regarding the authorship of AI-generated works is also a risk.\n\nCRITICAL REGULATORY GAPS:\n1. Absence of regulation on the use of AI for content generation (voices, texts, visual elements) in the publishing and cultural sector.\n2. Lack of clarity on the copyright of AI-generated or co-created works, and on the licensing of data for the training of AI models in the cultural sector.\n3. No disclosure or labeling requirements are established for AI-generated content in cultural publications.\n\nCONSIDERATIONS IN THE MEXICAN CONTEXT:\n- The protection of national cultural and artistic heritage, including literary works and authors' voices, is crucial. The use of AI must respect these rights.\n- Regulation must balance the promotion of technological innovation in the cultural sector with the protection of creators and the authenticity of content.\n- The enforcement capacity of INDAUTOR and other intellectual property institutions could be overwhelmed by the scale of AI content generation.",

This includes the analysis of satellite images, sensor data, predictive ecosystem modeling, and environmental change detection, all driven by AI/ML algorithms.\n\nIDENTIFIED RISKS:\nR1 (Malfunctions & Errors): Errors in algorithms for analyzing satellite images, detecting changes in land use, or ecosystem modeling could lead to incorrect conservation decisions, negatively affecting the biodiversity and natural resources of the NPAs. A failure to detect deforestation or pollution, for example, could have irreversible consequences.\n\nCRITICAL REGULATORY GAPS:\n1. Absence of specific regulation on the use of AI in environmental monitoring, change detection, and decision-making in NPA management.\n2. Lack of transparency and auditability requirements for algorithms used in geospatial and biological data analysis.\n3. No standards of accuracy or robustness are established for AI systems that inform critical conservation decisions.\n\nCONSIDERATIONS IN THE MEXICAN CONTEXT:\n- Mexico is a megadiverse country, and the protection of its NPAs is crucial. AI can be a powerful tool, but its failures can have significant environmental impacts.\n- Limited regulatory enforcement capacity and technical oversight of complex AI systems in the environmental field could be a challenge.\n- The participation of local communities in NPA management must be considered, and AI systems should not marginalize their traditional knowledge or rights.",

  "executive_summary": "This analysis of the Official Gazette of the Federation of November 12, 2025, reveals a total absence of explicit mentions of Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, a detailed forensic inspection identifies numerous implicit applications of AI technologies in various sectors of the Federal Public Administration, particularly in areas of Digital Government, Financial, Anti-Corruption, Demography, Culture, Tourism, and Environment. These applications are manifested through terms such as 'advanced data analysis', 'automation systems', 'computer platforms', 'biometric data', 'predictive models', and 'geographic information systems'.\n\nThe most critical risks identified, with 'Very High' or 'Extreme' severity, are concentrated in the digitalization of procedures and national identification with biometric data (SEDATU), where risks of errors, discrimination, privacy invasion, and loss of control are anticipated. Similarly, in the Secretariat of Anti-Corruption and Good Governance, the functions of patrimonial verification and fraud detection involve a high risk of algorithmic biases, false positives, and undue surveillance. Other significant risks include disinformation and copyright infringement in the cultural sector (FCE), and discrimination in demographic (SEGOB) and financial (SHCP) analyses.\n\nThe main conclusion is the existence of a critical 'regulatory gap': AI is already being implemented or its use is imminent in sensitive state functions, but current regulations do not explicitly address or regulate it. This leaves citizens and institutions exposed to the inherent risks of AI without the necessary safeguards. Urgent action is required to develop specific regulatory frameworks that guarantee transparency, fairness, data protection, and human oversight in the deployment of AI in the Mexican public sector.",
