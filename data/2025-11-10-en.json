This implies the use of AI in critical health areas, where errors or biases can have serious consequences. The mention of 'social prediction models' suggests the processing of sensitive data that could infer personal or socioeconomic characteristics, which raises the risks of discrimination (R2) and privacy (R3). A malfunction (R1) in a diagnosis or clinical risk prediction can have a direct and severe impact on patients' health. The delegation of 'prediction' tasks to AI without a clear oversight framework could lead to a gradual loss of control (R13).

The scale and nature of this collection and analysis of massive data ('big data') to 'precisely identify' and 'real-time location' strongly suggest the use of advanced algorithms, including potentially AI for profiling, predictive policing, or behavior pattern analysis.

  "executive_summary": "This Official Gazette of the Federation contains several documents from various Secretariats. The most critical findings relate to the Secretariat of Health and the Attorney General's Office of the State of Guanajuato. The National Institute of Perinatology (INPer) and the National Institute of Cancerology (INCan) explicitly mention the development and application of Artificial Intelligence to accelerate diagnoses, generate social prediction models of clinical risk in women, and develop predictive models of response to therapy using multiomics data. These applications, while seeking to improve health outcomes, pose extreme risks related to malfunction, algorithmic discrimination, privacy invasions of highly sensitive health data, and a possible gradual loss of human control over complex clinical decisions. The National Institute of Public Health (INSP) also plans to integrate AI into epidemiology and advanced data analysis for public health decision-making, which carries similar risks.\n\nFurthermore, the Attorney General's Office of the State of Guanajuato describes legal mandates for telecommunications providers to collaborate in real-time geographical location and extensive retention of communications data for security and justice purposes. Although AI is not explicitly named, the nature of these activities strongly suggests the use of advanced analytical algorithms, which heightens the risks of privacy invasions and authoritarian surveillance.\n\nThe main regulatory gap in all these findings is the absence of explicit frameworks, ethical guidelines, and oversight mechanisms to govern the development, implementation, and impact of these AI technologies. Urgent action is recommended to establish these safeguards, especially considering the Mexican context of limited resources for law enforcement, digital inequality, and the potential for systematic abuse of such powerful technologies.",
