    "urgency_justification": "Multiple regulatory gaps are identified in critical areas such as fiscal control, national coin production, public health (especially in vulnerability diagnosis and inclusive care models), and justice (care for victims of gender violence). These gaps imply risks of malfunction, algorithmic discrimination, privacy invasion, and loss of control, with the potential to affect fundamental rights and economic and social stability. The absence of explicit mention of AI in these high-risk contexts, where its use is highly probable, requires immediate attention to establish appropriate governance frameworks."

  "executive_summary": "The Official Gazette of the Federation of November 3, 2025, contains various publications from Secretariats and autonomous bodies. Although none explicitly mention 'Artificial Intelligence' or 'AI', a forensic analysis reveals multiple contexts where its application is highly probable or imminent, generating significant regulatory risks and gaps.\n\nThe most critical findings are concentrated in high-automation and massive data processing systems. In the fiscal area (SAT), the security code systems for tobacco companies and the validation of CFDI/CSD, as well as the volumetric controls for hydrocarbons, present risks of malfunction, authoritarian surveillance, and loss of control if AI is implemented without transparency or auditability. In the Mexican Mint, the institutional program 2025-2030 seeks 'technological innovations' and 'process optimization' for minting and sustainability, which opens the door to AI with risks of labor displacement and errors in a critical State function.\n\nParticularly concerning are the agreements of the Secretariat of Health and the Secretariat of Women. In Health, the 'Diagnosis of people in vulnerable situations' and the 'Health Care Model with Inclusive Mechanisms' are areas of high risk for algorithmic discrimination and privacy invasion. In the Secretariat of Women, the data collection in the 'National Bank of Data and Information on Cases of Violence against Women (BANAVIM)' and the 'treatment of gender violence' with possible technological tools, if they involve AI, entail extreme risks of bias and privacy for vulnerable victims. The lack of specific regulation for AI in these sensitive domains is an urgent call to action to protect fundamental rights and ensure accountability.",

The absence of a specific regulatory framework for AI in these documents, coupled with the technical complexity of the systems and the limitation of human and financial resources for oversight, suggests a limited enforcement capacity for AI risks.
